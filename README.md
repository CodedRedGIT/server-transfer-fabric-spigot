<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This mod & plugin allows the player to transfer to another server that's not in the same network. Thus, giving the user easy, quick, and user-friendly access to all servers within the NFTWorlds launcher (or even outside of it). 

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How It Works

Currently, this product includes a Fabric Mod and a Spigot Plugin. The client/launcher will run the mod while the specific server runs the plugin. Having a Spigot plugin communicate with Fabric Mod allows much customization for the server. The server can use the plugin's API to give the player unique ways to transfer to another server. An example of the process would be; an event triggers the transfer player method within the ServerTransferPlugin's API which then communicates with the mod to issue the actual transfering. 

<!-- Coming Soon -->
## Coming Soon

Much more implementations are coming to this mod and plugin. Many pre-made plugins are in development as well as a client mod.
